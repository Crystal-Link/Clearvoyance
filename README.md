# Clearvoyance
The problem that this team is taking on is that outdoor architectural lighting and advertising are extremely expensive. It typically requires a team of engineers and construction workers to install the required electrical systems, making it virtually impossible for small businesses or older buildings to make use of such lighting systems. 
Our project, which we are calling  Clearvoyance, will allow even small businesses to access the lighting and advertising that would typically be reserved for big corporations and buildings. Our proposed design removes the complexities and costs associated with exterior lighting through the use of wireless modules, which can be easily placed on the sides of buildings or windows. Each module will be composed of various RGB LEDs, which when synchronized together could turn any building into a vibrant display. In essence, our technology will allow for easier access to customizable lighting or advertisements for individuals or businesses, big or small.
