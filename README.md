# Clearvoyance
Clearvoyance is a transparent, customizable, and modular storefront display which can double as an emergency alert system in the event of an emergency. 

Technically speaking, Clearvoyance makes use of clear LCD screens with plexiglass backlighting. Each of these modules can be used as a transparent display similar to a computer monitor. The modules will be controlled by a central computer system that allows stores and emergency services to push content to be displayed on the screens. For instance, stores could have seasonal promotions on display, and agencies could post visual notifications for emergencies like flooding. Businesses can also configure multiple modules together to form a larger display. One possibility could be placing modules in a 3-by-3 grid to fill a full storefront window. An important note is that although Clearvoyance is transparent like a window, Clearvoyance is not intended as a window itself. It could be placed behind a storefront window for similar effects, but it is not designed for long-term outdoor exposure. 

To get our system on the market, we plan to market it first as a method of in-store advertising. Then, if our product is well-adopted by stores, we will expand to collaborate with emergency services. Because our sign can work as an emergency alert system, it could potentially be subsidized by local governments and emergency alert agencies for small businesses.
